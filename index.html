    <h1>Creatve Statement</h1>
<img src="DSCF0356.JPG" width="200" height="200">
    <p> My work as an artist revolves around visual mediums, focusing on 
photography and filmmaking. In using these visual mediums I will focus on
themes of femininity, girlhood, freedom and being in your adolescence.
girlhood, freedom and being in your adolescence.Through experimenting 
with light, textures and blending images, I will communicate these themes
and share them digitally. Most of my work is inspired by my own personal 
experiences and the way I observe and see the world. I am interested in 
how girlhood and femininity are constructed and performed within digital 
spaces, where images are constantly circulated, fragmented, and 
reinterpreted. By sharing my own perspective, I aim to reclaim girlhood 
as something self-defined rather than idealized and consumed.
